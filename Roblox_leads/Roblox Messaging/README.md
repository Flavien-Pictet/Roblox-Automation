_____________________________________TL/DR_______________________________________


So the goal is to automate the outreach process which can be quite time consuming, this bot therefore allows us to automate friends requests inside Roblox devs communites. We can’t send messages without being friends at first so that’s why I’m doing this.

If you want to run it from your Roblox account you just need to modify your login information inside the script at line 13 & 14.


If you want to modify the community link in order to Sybil another community, you can copy paste the link of the Roblox dev community and paste it at line 22 & 28 inside the ( ‘… ‘ ) , the exact line number might change if I add things to the script in the future
